# A sample idea (note) app

Using firebase in React Native and Expo

## Instalation and running
I assumed that you already installed npm, yarn and expo!

    - git clone https://github.com/triplea24/expo-app-ideapad.git
    - cd expo-app-ideapad/
    - yarn install

### Important
Create a file called firebase.js inside the project's directory and put the firebase config variable there.

To run the project just simply run this command:
    `exp start`
