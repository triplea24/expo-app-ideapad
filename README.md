# Login with Firebase

Using firebase in React Native and Expo

## Instalation and running
I assumed that you already installed npm, yarn and expo!

    - git clone https://github.com/triplea24/expo-firebase-authentication-example.git
    - cd expo-firebase-authentication-example/
    - yarn install

### Important
Create a file called firebase.js inside the project's directory and put the firebase config variable there.

To run the project just simply run this command:
    `exp start`
